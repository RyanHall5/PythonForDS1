# Gender Predictors

This repository contains two Python scripts related to predicting gender (male or female) based on the physical characteristics: height, weight, and shoe-size.


## Files

- **file.py**
    This file follows along with a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg&ab_channel=SirajRaval) explaining machine learning techniques for gender classification.

- **gender_predictors.py**
    This file contains my unique solution to the challenge presented at the end of the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg&ab_channel=SirajRaval). 
    The challenge is essentially as follows: Compare the accuracies of 3 different sciKit-Learn classification models for determining gender based on physical characteristics.


## Requirements
 - Python 3.x
 - scikit-learn


## How to Run

 To run the tutorial example file: 
 ```bash 
 python file.py
 ```

To run the challenge solution:
```bash
python gender_predictors.py
```
